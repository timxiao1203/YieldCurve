# Yield Curve

The term structure of interest rates, also known as yield curve, is defined as the relationship between the yield-to-maturity on a zero coupon bond and the bondâ€™s maturity. Zero yield curves play an essential role in the valuation of all financial products. 

Yield curves can be derived from government bonds or LIBOR/swap instruments. The LIBOR/swap term structure offers several advantages over government curves, and is a robust tool for pricing and hedging financial products.  Correlations among governments and other fixed-income products have declined, making the swap term structure a more efficient hedging and pricing vehicle.

Yield curve is widely regarded as the best proxy for risk-free curve and benchmark curve. Yield curves can be derived from government bonds or LIBOR/swap instruments. The LIBOR/swap term structure offers several advantages over government curves, and is a robust tool for pricing and hedging financial products.  Correlations among governments and other fixed-income products have declined, making the swap term structure a more efficient hedging and pricing vehicle.

Liquidity of underlying instrumennts is crucial. Since the swap market is a very liquid market with narrow bid-ask spreads and a wide selection of maturities, yield curves derived from swap curves offer several advantages over government curves (e.g., treasury yield curve). With the supply of government bond issues declining, yield curves are mainly bootstrapped from swap curves.
